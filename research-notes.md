# Research Notes

## Research Questions

- What is the main advantage of containers over classical deployment? How do they compare security wise?
- What type of container architecture is mainly used at the moment?
- Could there be an architecture for containerized applications which is more secure by default? I.e. how to design for security?
- What is the preferable way to store the configuration (container command + usernames/passwords) when using containers (Infra as code? alternatives?)?
	- This specifically refers to safety against loss of data
	- and security against theft of credentials
