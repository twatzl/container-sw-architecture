# Research Notes

## Research Questions

- How would a secure by default architecture for containerized software would look like?
	- safely store configuration + credentials
- How would this architecture then compare security wise e.g. to classical direct deployment or VM deployment?

## Notes about paper structure

What type of container architectures are used at the moment?
